To get a "pixel-perfect" result from an AI web builder (like Framer AI, Wix Studio, or ChatGPT-to-code), you need to be extremely specific about structure, layout, colors, and content hierarchy.

Here is a comprehensive prompt you can copy and paste directly into your AI web builder.

### Copy and Paste this Prompt:

> **Role:** Expert UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer.
> **Task:** Build a "Contact Us" page that matches the attached design exactly. The page must be fully responsive and integrate seamlessly with a dark-themed website.
> **Global Style & Theme:**
> * **Background:** Deep Black (`#000000`) for the main content area.
> * **Typography:** Modern Sans-Serif font (e.g., Roboto, Inter, or Open Sans). Text color is White (`#FFFFFF`) or Light Grey (`#CCCCCC`) for body text.
> * **Accent Color:** Bright Red (`#D60000` or similar) for buttons and active states.
> 
> 
> **Section 1: Hero / Header**
> * **Layout:** Full-width hero section.
> * **Image:** A high-quality action shot of a dance troupe in red jackets and khaki shorts performing on stage.
> * **Overlay:** The text "CONTACT US" is placed in the bottom-left corner of the hero image.
> * **Font Style:** Large, uppercase, white sans-serif font for the overlay.
> 
> 
> **Section 2: Contact Interface (Main Content)**
> * **Container:** Centered container with substantial vertical padding (top and bottom).

> * **Left Column ("Get in Touch"):**
> * **Heading:** "Get in Touch" (H2 size, White).
> * **Content:** A list including "CONTACT US", "Email" (red text for the address), "Phone" (red text for number), "Address", and "Social Media Links" with small red icons.
> 
> 
> * **Right Column (Contact Form):**
> * **Fields:** Four outline-style input fields: Name, Email, Subject, and Message (large text area).
> * **Input Style:** Dark transparent background, white border, white placeholder text.
> * **Button:** A rectangular "SEND MESSAGE" button aligned to the left of the form column.
> * **Button Style:** Solid Red background, White uppercase text, no border radius (sharp corners).
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **Section 3: Map Integration**
> * **Placement:** Immediately below the two-column contact section.
> * **Component:** A wide Google Maps embed showing the location "HHMZ DANCE SCHOOL".
> * **Style:** Standard map view, taking up roughly 60-70% of the viewport width, centered.
> 
> 
> **Section 4: Footer**
> * **Layout:** A minimal footer section at the bottom with a black background.
> * **Content:** Navigation links on the left, a small map thumbnail on the right (if required), and copyright text.
> 
> 
> **Technical Constraints:**
> * Ensure strictly left-aligned typography for all headings and form labels.
> * Maintain high contrast between the black background and white text for accessibility.
> * Ensure the form and map resize fluidly for mobile devices.
